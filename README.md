**Abstract:**

The process of providing user interface (UI) reviews and feedback often involves cumbersome steps that hinder productivity. Taking screenshots, manually annotating them, and uploading files to pull requests or issues consumes valuable time. To streamline this workflow, we propose a tool named Review Lens that allows users to effortlessly draw, annotate, and comment directly on top of the web app or website interfaces. This tool aims to enhance the UI review process by providing a seamless way to provide visual feedback within the context of version control platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

**Problem Statement:**

The traditional approach to UI reviews involves several time-consuming steps, such as capturing screenshots, using external image editing software for annotations, and then uploading the modified images to version control platforms. This process can lead to inefficiencies, confusion, and a lack of context. Moreover, teams working on UI design and development often struggle with maintaining a streamlined communication flow between designers, developers, and project managers.

**Proposed Solution:**

Our proposed solution is a tool that simplifies and accelerates the UI review process. Users can use this tool as a browser extension to directly annotate and comment on web apps or website interfaces. By integrating this tool with version control platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, users can seamlessly attach their feedback to merge/pull requests or issues. This approach provides real-time visual feedback within the context of the project, eliminating the need for external image editing and multiple file uploads. Additionally, the tool promotes collaboration among designers, developers, and stakeholders, fostering a smoother communication flow and quicker decision-making.

By implementing a solution, we aim to optimize the UI review process, saving time, enhancing clarity, and fostering better collaboration among team members. This tool has the potential to transform how UI reviews are conducted, making them more efficient, effective, and user-friendly.

|Xiaoying Liu, Yu Zhang, and Yifan Zhang|A Systematic Literature Review on User Interface Feedback|2020|<p>The paper offers a thorough analysis of the user interface feedback literature. The authors describe the many user interface feedback types, the difficulties in giving useful feedback, and the techniques for assessing input. According to the authors, user interface feedback is crucial because it enables users to learn the system, understand their actions and the system, and remedy mistakes. They contend that additional research is required in this area because there is still much that we do not know about how to deliver useful user interface feedback.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>|
